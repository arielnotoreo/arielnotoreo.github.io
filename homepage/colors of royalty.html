                 Walking into the park I had never been to, seeing the metal poles colored with red and yellow, I remember noticing how vibrant everything was. An interesting color choice, I noted. A big sprinkler in the middle divided the vast playground into two, I was awed. It wasn't the park, but the energy I’d felt walking into the area after a long day at Chinese school; it was freeing.

                 It was never hard for me to find people to play with despite being quite shy when meeting new folks. My father would always step in and ask if I could play with people. I don’t think I'll ever be more grateful for my dad’s outgoing personality than that day. That was the first day my father and I single-handedly coerced the whole playground into one giant game of tag. That was the first moment I’d ever had at Chinatown Park, the moment I knew that I could not stop going to the place that made me have more fun than I ever did in my past three years of living.

                 Although we called it “Chinatown Park”, there were actually two in Chinatown. To us, this one was the only park that mattered. Every day we would spend time with the same people. The old people who would sing in front of the park were always the same, the workers were the same, it was a repetitive cycle that gave me peace.

                 Regardless of who stopped by, the regulars always made everyone feel welcome. Among us, there were exactly three groups of people: the senior section, teenagers, and kids. The senior section would take up the whole front of the park, gambling and arguing with each other over games of Chinese chess and poker. The seniors who would send their kids off to the playground with some cash for food,  a gentle scolding to be careful before spending their hours with their gambling friends.

                  The teenagers usually never played with us little kids, thinking they were “too cool” to hang out with us. There were a few that stuck with us, usually older siblings or maybe those that loved playing our games. They were the cool ones. The others would spend time doing teenage things, going where they wanted rather than playing with us cooler kids, but they had their significance. We didn’t interact much, but they were our protectors from bullies, creepy adults, and other meaner teens. If there was no one else around, we went to them for help.

                 Then, you have the kids. Personally, I thought we were the most fun. We would run around the jungle gym and play various games that, due to our lack of adult supervision, would be games that were rather dangerous for the average child. We played large games of tag, infection*, mountain tag*, cops and robbers, and other games we’d come up with on the spot. The rules were set when adults played, but when we played on our own? The possibilities were endless. We were kings, queens, flying higher than the clouds in the sky, the red and yellow glistening in the sunlight, colors fit for the passion we felt, the power we had, the colors fit for royalty. The fun we had, the games we played, all of it we owed to the park.

                 Why is the park there? To give you a standard answer it’s because the community needed a place where people could socialize. Why do I think the park is there? I think it was put there to allow me to escape from the world of problems I had at home and school, so that little me could play just like children did instead of worrying whether mommy and daddy still loved each other.

                 Looking back I feel as if it was that way for all of us. We all had our own problems. Many of us had our struggles and our home lives weren’t always the best. We all knew what pain felt like, but we never spoke of it. The park wasn’t the place to talk about that. It was the place to get bruises, be stupid, and just have fun. It was our one escape into paradise. That's why I think Chinatown Park is where it is.

                 I can confirm that the park gave me some of the best memories I'll ever have. I’ll never forget what it felt like to be in such a community, even though it wasn’t exactly a stable friend group. I never see the other kids anymore, except for one girl: my oldest friend, now in college. We don’t always talk, often going months without chatting, but once we do it’s like the gap never existed. We still bond over being the remains of Chinatown Park, the only two that truly miss being young and back there again.

                 Sometimes when I’m in the area I go back and look at how it is now. The monkey bars are a lot shorter than I remember, my body doesn't fit through the gaps between the bars as easily. The fun and lively atmosphere of the playground is no longer apparent, there are fewer adults in the senior section, and the games that kids play are no longer park-wide, only four-five kids at most. Going back is like rewatching a show you haven’t seen in years, the nostalgia too intense to disregard.

                 I cannot tell you the number of times I've sat in my thoughts and reminisced about the fun I had at that park, how much I miss going there. I cannot express how much it saddens me that I’ll never experience something like that again, that none of my best friends will ever know what it felt like to have that much fun in a playground. It’s kind of sad to go back there and see how different it is and compare it to how much fun it used to be. Chinatown Park is no longer the same haven it was to the children in my generation, now it’s just what it was meant to be: a park.
